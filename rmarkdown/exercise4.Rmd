Here is a cached chunk. The first time you run it, it will take ~5 seconds to generate because we are setting the system to sleep for 5 seconds before printing (we are mimicing a computationally intensive function). Any subsequent runs should not take as long, becase the results are cached on your machine. 

Play around with it a little. Try setting `cache=FALSE`. Does it run slower?
```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Sleep for five second
Sys.sleep(5)
# Print a result
paste("This took me a long time to run!")
```
