# Rmarkdown
## Excercise 1
### Basic markdown syntax

Markdown is a text format that can be converted to formats such as HTML. The syntax is really easy. Here are some lists. Remember to use four spaces to indent.

  - Markdown 
      + is
          + awesome
  - and easy
  - to use

Numbered lists are also similar

1. We are
2. the EMBL
    + predocs

> Here is a 
> quote block 


This text is written in markdown. Here is some *italic text*, you can also use _underscores_. Here is some **bold text**, you can also use __double uncderscores__.

I can superscript like this 27^th^ and ~~strikeout like this~~.

Creating a link is very easy. Here is one to [EMBL's awesome website](http://embl.org/) yay. 

Here is a simple table

Table Header  | Second Header
------------- | -
Table Cell    | Cell 2
Cell 3        | Cell 4

It's also very easy to include an image from the internet or your computer
![EMBL logo](http://embl.org/layout/images/external/common/embl_logo.png)

I can also write some code like this `print("hello world")`
